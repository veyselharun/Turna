# Turna

Turna is a control flow graph (CFG) reconstructor for RISC-V architecture.

It performs hybrid CFG reconstruction. It analyzes RISC-V assembly code with the help of trace (run-time) information generated by gem5 architecture simulator. After analysis, Turna detects basic blocks of the program and reconstructs its CFG.

Turna is open-source and licensed under the MIT license.
