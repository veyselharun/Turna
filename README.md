# Yelkovan

Yelkovan is a hybrid program analyzer for RISC-V architecture.

It analyzes RISC-V assembly code with the help of trace information generated by gem5 simulator. After analysis, Yelkovan detects basic blocks of the program and creates its control flow graph (CFG).

The main aim of Yelkovan is to help worst-case execution time (WCET) calculation. However, you can also use it to help performance analysis of programs from different aspects as it determines the basic blocks and CFGs of the programs.

Yelkovan is open source and licensed under the MIT license.
